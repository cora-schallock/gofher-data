# About this run:

This run was conducted on the [PANSTARRS-1 images](https://github.com/cora-schallock/spin-parity-catalog-data) using the Algorithm 1 Ellipse Mask Fitting described in Schallock & Hayes 2024. Here GOFHER was run on a bined image, with bin size of 4x4, that was done prior to parameter fitting. To recreate, use the following settings:

    bin_size = 4 
    bin_prior_to_param_fitting = True
